#Introduction
The purpose of this document is to outline the individual project specification that you will be
working on during the training. This project will encapsulate concepts from all core training
modules – more specifically, this will involve:
! Agile & Project Management (Git, Jira)
! Databases & Cloud Fundamentals (MySQL)
! Programming Fundamentals (Java)
! API Development (Spring Boot)
! Automated Testing (JUnit)
You may tweak this project to any subject, business case, or hobby which you deem fit – e.g. a todo
list, library, supermarket system, stat tracker, etc. – provided that it encapsulates all aspects of the
aforementioned modules, and that it is fully CRUD functional.
Your API must be fully functional and capable of handling HTTP requests from a tool such as
Postman. You must be able to show that data has been persisted to your database using a tool such
as MySQL Workbench.


#Objective
The overall objective of the project is the following:
To create a Spring Boot API, with utilisation of supporting tools, methodologies, and
technologies, that encapsulates all fundamental and practical modules covered during
training.
Specifically, you are required to create a Spring Boot API using:
! an application back-end developed using the language from your Programming Fundamentals
module (e.g. Java)
! a managed database hosted locally (e.g. MySQL (local / GCP)
! a means of making API calls (Postman) and a means of checking persistence (Workbench)
If you wish to use any technologies which have not been covered as part of your training,
you must consult your trainer first.
You must plan the approach you will take to complete this project using the design techniques you
have learned.
Your project is expected to have been rigorously tested in the key areas explored above, using the
technologies covered during all fundamental and practical modules (e.g. JUnit).
